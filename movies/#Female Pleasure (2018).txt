Description: &quot;#女狠女War&quot; is a journey exploring women&#39;s gender issues in the 21st century. This film records five women from different places who were humiliated and oppressed in a patriarchal society. They broke their silence and had the courage to speak out about the injustices they faced under the inherent system. Their experiences all have one thing in common: their bodies have lost autonomy and their desires have been deprived. The film will show how these five brave women spoke out in a conservative cultural atmosphere.
