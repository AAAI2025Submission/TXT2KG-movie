Description: Stephen (Alain Chabat) is a well-known chef with a happy family and a successful career. He is a role model in the eyes of others. But even though his life is so perfect, Stephen still feels empty inside, as if there is a black hole that will not echo no matter what is thrown into it. Stephen met a male and female artist named Xiu (Bae Doona) on the Internet. The two hit it off and talked happily. Whether it was the trivialities of life or the pursuit of art, they could resonate, like a pair of soul mates. Finally, Stephen could no longer be satisfied with just getting along with Xiu on the Internet, so he decided to go to South Korea to meet Xiu. But when Stephen arrived in South Korea, he found that Xiu had lost his message, and he was trapped at the airport and couldn&#39;t leave.
