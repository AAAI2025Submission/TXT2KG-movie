Description: Vincent (Lebghil William) is the best friend of Nafeli (Margot Bancilhon), so after Vincent suffered a catastrophic breakup, Nafeli decided to comfort him with her body. Nafeli invited Vincent to live in her house, and the two made three rules: only make love, not fall in love. So, the two people who were reveling every night began their absurd life of debauchery. One day, Vincent met a girl named Julie (Camille Razat), and he fell in love with Julie as his destined girl, and he broke his vow with Nafeli. Vincent&#39;s love affair made Nafeli crazy, and even Nafeli herself did not expect that her possessiveness of Vincent was so strong, and the two women started a peach war.
