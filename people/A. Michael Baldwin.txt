Quotes
We took a promotional trip to Japan when I was in the eighth grade, after Kenny & Company (1976) came out, and when we stepped off the plane it was just like the Beatles. It was awesome. We were chased down the street by 200 screaming Japanese girls and had to dive into a limousine to escape. And then, of course, they swarmed the car. It was great.
I continued being an actor until I was probably 22 or something like that. I did lots of commercials and television and the whole routine. Studied acting, became a musician, and then when all my friends went off to college, I went off and found an Indian guru and lived on an ashram and had a grand time there.
Jazz is America's only original art form.
I don't stay away from them, but I generally don't find myself buying a ticket to a horror film.
[on the cast and crew of the Phantasm series] We get along famously. I mean, we've all known each other forever. I've known Don since I was 11 and he was 19. So that's a long time! And Reggie also, I've known him since I was probably 11 or 12 years old, so we've known each other a long time. It's a fun and funny and goofy kind of atmosphere when we get together because we all sort of get the joke. We are all in on it!! And Angus, he's a very funny and charming gentleman, and always a pleasure.
