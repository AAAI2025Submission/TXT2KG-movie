Name: A.K. Strom

Mini Bio
A.K Strom is a New Zealand-born filmmaker whose first feature was released in 2016 and whose second feature ' World War Four' is due out in 2019. Before his feature-film career, Strom came from a long history in small documentaries, TV and music videos. His movies tend to contain spectacular visual elements, though his focus is on "realism" and a documentary-style of shooting. He says that due to modern technology, even smaller independent productions can now take on much more of a Sci-fi 'epic' feel, while still keeping their "indie" sensibility.

Both of Strom's first features fall into the "apocalyptic thriller" genre, though 'World War Four' is much more of an Action film.
